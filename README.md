# configs

These are the config files I am currently using.

You are free to use them if you wish.

## Setup

first clone this repo.

You should be able to put it whereever you want it.

cd into the project and run the install script.
```bash
./install.sh
```

this will create a symbolic link in your home directory to the necessary config files.

I mostly use oh-my-zsh for my terminal, so you may want to consider installing that.

I have included a sane bash profile, borrowed from [jsbarrett](https://www.github.com/jsbarrett/vim-setup)
